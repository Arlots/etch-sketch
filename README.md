*************
- Create a base HTML skeleton document and link script/style files *done*
- Create a single container in the HTML file to hold a square grid of divs. (960px?) *done*
- style the base body and container first *done*
- Use JS to generate a 16x16 grid inside the container. 
- Use flexbox to align boxes inside the container. *done*
- add an event lister to each grid div to listen for a "hover" effect. *done*
- When hover is detected, the color of the grid box should change. *done*
- Add a button at the top of the screen that will ask the user for dimensions of a new grid then run a function to replace the current grid with the new grid. *done*

+====Extra Credit - Will not be doing at the present time.
- Have a "pressue mode" that incrementally changes the color. 1 pass over = 10% darker.
- Have a "random color mode" that fills the square with a random color instead of black.
